           My name is Alba N. Cisneros
           I'm a El Paso, TX native, received my BA in Criminal Jusice with a Minor in Forensic Psychology.
           I've been a volunteer at sexual assault crisis center, I've also been a substitute teacher for
           EPISD (El Paso Independent School Disctric);
           I've been employed with Do√±a Ana County as a correctional officer; worked with youth as a youth

           <p>
                    In 2011 I began working at the El Paso Communications Department as a Public Safety Communicator, 
           was cross trained to handle both incoming emergency calls as well as dispatch units to emergecies.
           I am currently working for a non-profit agency in which I work with At-Risk youth with the sole purpose to
           keep the students in school.
